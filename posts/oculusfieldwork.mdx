Located in Downtown Manhattan, the Oculus is a large, oval structure seemingly embedded in the ground. It is covered with white ribs that extend into two sweeping spikes that reach up and out, symbolic of a hand releasing a dove. It sits just yards away from One World Trade Center, also known as the Freedom Tower, which stands in place of where the Twin Towers had once stood prior to the attacks of September 11th. The Oculus was created as part of a plan to rebuild the World Trade Center and prove the world that the U.S. was stronger than ever. This particular structure was designed to symbolize a hand releasing a dove. Fun fact, the orientation of the large spines atop the structure is more than just decorative, they also correspond to the sun’s solar angles on September 11th at 8:46AM and 10:28AM, which mark when the first plane struck and when the second of the Twin Towers collapsed, respectively.

The Oculus is a public space that functions as a transportation hub and shopping destination. Underground, the Oculus hosts over 12 subway lines and a PATH station. It is interconnected with Fulton Center, Brookfield Place, and other parts of the Financial District. The Oculus also hosts many retail and luxury stores, making it an attractive shopping destination. Cafes, bakeries, dining halls, and restaurants can also be found inside. But on top of everything, the Oculus also serves a third, memorialistic purpose: a symbol of resilience.

The symmetry and grandeur of the Oculus makes it a prime location for Instagram pictures. It draws in crowds of tourists from all over the world, who wander in and marvel at the architecture, seemingly unable to stop snapping photos here and there. One of the most striking aspects of the Oculus is how white everything is. The use of smooth white ribs, glass windows, and marble floor feels sleek and modern. At the same time, its vast size but shocking emptiness makes it cold and sterile. This results in a futuristic effect that establishes that the World Trade Center is progressive and advances, at the forefront of global business and trade.

It is not just the architecture of the Oculus that holds up this image, but the addition of the commuters further reinforces it. The commuters of the Oculus are individuals in business suits, ties, and briefcases. They walk briskly along marble floors, in their own little bubbles, with seemingly no interest or awareness that they are in the Oculus. They weave in and out of crowds, dodging opposing commuters, trying to get to their destination as fast as possible. There is a stark contrast between the slow, unsure steps of the tourists and the snapping, demanding walk of the commuters. New Yorkers are known for their fast pace of walking, but in the Oculus it is particularly accentuated and seems to capture the bustle of global trade in the World Trade Center.

Where did the Oculus get its name from? The word “oculus” usually refers to a round opening or glass, and mean “eye” in Latin. The name specifically refers to the fact that from the ground floor, one is able to peer through the glass slit high up on the ceiling and spot the towering Freedom Tower. Remember, the floor of the Oculus sits around four stories below the ground. This particular view makes the Freedom Tower look breathtakingly tall. For me, it almost felt like coming out of the rubble after 9/11 and seeing a strong-standing New York gleaming against the sky. The Oculus’s proximity and depth in the ground physically helps magnify the Freedom Tower’s as a symbol of strength and resilience.

Perhaps unintentionally, the Oculus’s name could also refer to it being a prime site for people watching. Multiple factors make it so. Since the interior is so spacious, there is almost nothing to see but people on the elliptical marble floor. Glass barriers reveal the entirety of the floor level to any viewer, facilitating people watching. Best of all, the commuters pay no mind to the tourists, allowing them to observe them as they walk by. For tourists, the steady stream of commuters rushing through the space serves as a living exhibit—tangible proof that the World Trade Center site, and New York City itself, has not only survived but thrived in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.

It feels very intentional that the architecture of the Oculus also facilitates people watching. Every single level of the Oculus circles around the central main floor, almost like a continuous balcony. The edges of the balcony give tourists a relief from the circulation of people, but also functions as great places to conduct people watching. It is super easy to observe at any angle and observe any level, providing plenty of choice and variety.

The urban design of a commuter passageway to function as a tourist hotspot and provoke interesting reflections on collective memory and resilience. The Oculus is not just an architectural gem, it is also an ingenious design of an urban public space that functions as a commuter passageway and as a tourist hotspot, and can provoke interesting reflections on the strength and resilience of the World Trade Center. The Oculus ultimately serves as a physical metaphor for New York City itself—constantly moving forward and bouncing back despite the tragedies of the past.
